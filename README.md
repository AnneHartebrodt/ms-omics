## Relevant GEO records

This study incorporates multiple different data modalities.
- White matter brain lesion tissue spatial transcriptomics (8 slides)
- snRNASeq of microdisected white matter lesion tissue from different lesion types and several donors and controls.
- snATACSeq of microdisected white matter lesion tissue from different lesions and several donors and controls.
- tissue (bulk) RNASeq of MS white matter lesions based on 10 MS patients and 5 controls.

Newly sequenced records are available under the GEO accession number GEO???. Tissue RNASeq used in a prior study has been reused. This data is available under the GEO accession number GSE138614.
